One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

Recently I learned the importance of staying on top of your assignments and managing your work-life balance. Lately its seems like I've taken more of a focus on work and less at school, and it has been impacting my ability to stay on top of turning things in on a timely manner. I also learned the importance of accepting where you are and working within the range of your abilities. I had beeen getting frustrated at my lack of ability to learn coding more efficiently, but eventually I just hit a wall where I accepted where I was at in my learning process and just tried to work within my parameters.
