Today I learned:

I learned that it can be more beneficial to work with one TA for an extended period of time rather than bounce between whoever is immediately available. Everyon has a unique approach, so switching around means each person has to start from ground zero, orient themselves to your code, then try to hep with a solution. It was a really insightful process, and I learned a lot form last Saturday. I als learned the value in productive work. i was very tired during the last lab, and I found that it was impacting my ability to absorb the material being given to me. There is a big difference between simply being present in an environment and being actively present within your environment. I also found that I really seem to be struggling with the concepts of rendering material. I'm going to try to find other sources in an attempt to fill in the gaps of my learning, and hope that it sticks better within my mind.
