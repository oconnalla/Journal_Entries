Have you always felt the way you do now? If you have successfully lowered the number you'd use to rate your Imposter Syndrome, how have you done so?

I'd say on a scale of 1-10 I probably hit about an 8. I find that I feel this way more as I go along. I wouldn't say it necessarily impacts my work or desire to continue with coding, it's just more of an awareness of how little I know about coding particularly in comparison to my peers. I suppose you could say that I have imposter system, and while it sort of bums me out, I also don't particularly care? Not being the best seems like the stupidest reason to give up, so I don't see why it impacts me-except to push me to do more!
