Consider the "learning pyramid as shown in the image below. Do you find that matches the way that you learn, or would you weight the activities differently? If so, how?

I think that lecture compsrises more of my ability to learn but I would usually pair lecture and demonstration together as one. I also think it helps to talk it out while doing it. Above all, I really like to be instructed while doing things myself. Having what I'm doing explained to me as I am directly doing the material really seems to help me learn. I am finding that repetition in this area of learning also seems to really help. I'm hoping that if I do this enough, the easier to grasp aspects will become second nature and allow me more capability/time to really hone in on the more difficult aspects of learning to code.
