Motivation and goals are an important part of adult learning; so is adapting to and gaining insight from things you did not anticipate. What would you say is the most unexpected part of this experience, and how have you learned from it?

The most unanticipated part of this experience is how different my learning style is from the learning techniques presented in class. As hard as the transition has been, I find it very practical because it is forcing me to find alternative ways to retain information and to learn to independantly seek information. I think the method is a fitting parallel to experiencing having to find resources by myself within a work environment. It's been hard for me, but it's forcing independence and teaching me to use various tools and resources. It is also forcing me to reach out more to my classmates than I usually might, which promotes a team environment.
