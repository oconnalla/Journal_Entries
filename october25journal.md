Today I learned the importance of teamwork, and the importance in waiting to see results. I've been reaching out to get a lot of help, and multiple people are saying that they are starting to see significant progress in my ability to grasp the material. I personally haven't experienced that as much, but 3 people independently said that, so it may just be a matter of tiem before I feel that way too. I'm trying to really adjust to the new level of patience I'm finding is needed for coding. 
I also learned the value in laying things all out on the table with your team and to watch for someone who is being extra quiet. I noticed a team member becomign quiet and I tried to make sure they felt like they had an equal sya and were involved in the decision making process. I'm really trying to be extra aware of those subtle cues throughout this week.
